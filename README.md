# Glasklart PScripts
Photoshop javascripts for automatic generating Glasklart icons.

This scripts are ***NOT*** automatic generating Glasklart icons from the original artwork files, this scripts need a opaque black/transparent 1024x1024px source file [as described here](https://github.com/glasklart/hd/wiki/How-to-Contribute-an-Icon#icon-sources)!

The scripts containing "_Smart" in the filename are only working with Photoshop CS6 and Photoshop CC, because they are using smart objects.

Adobe ExtendScript Toolkit must be installed to use the .jsx-files!
